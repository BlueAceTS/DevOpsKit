      "Rationale": "Data/content in projects that have public visibility can be downloaded by anyone on the internet without authentication. This can lead to a compromise of corporate data.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

A user account that gets compromised (say via a phishing attack) immediately subjects the entire Azure DevOps organization to risk if it is privileged with critical roles in the organization. Use of smartcard-backed alternate (SC-ALT) accounts instead protects the organization from this risk.",
